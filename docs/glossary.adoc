== Introduction

This glossary defines terms and concepts used throughout the cicd-hyper-a documentation. Terms are organized alphabetically within categories.

== Core Concepts

[[action]]
Action::
The operation performed when a rule's condition matches. Actions can inject files, reject commits, create alerts, or trigger other responses. See <<developer-guide.adoc#writing-rules,Writing Rules>>.

[[adapter]]
Adapter::
A component that translates between cicd-hyper-a's internal operations and a specific forge's API. Each supported forge (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) has its own adapter. See <<developer-guide.adoc#forge-adapter-development,Forge Adapter Development>>.

[[audit-log]]
Audit Log::
A chronological record of all changes to a ruleset, including versions, authors, verifications, and signatures. Provides complete provenance tracking.

[[auto-fix]]
Auto-Fix::
The automatic application of a curative rule to resolve an issue without human intervention. Auto-fixes have a confidence score indicating reliability.

[[bot-fleet]]
Bot Fleet::
A coordinated set of bots that work together to analyze and fix repositories. Bots execute in dependency order to avoid conflicts.

[[cache]]
Cache::
The Dragonfly-based high-performance cache layer that stores compiled rules for sub-millisecond lookups.

[[condition]]
Condition::
A logical expression that determines when a rule applies. Conditions can check file existence, content patterns, language usage, and more. Conditions can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT operators.

[[confidence-score]]
Confidence Score::
A value from 0.0 to 1.0 indicating how reliable an auto-fix is. Higher scores indicate fixes learned from many successful applications. Rules with confidence below a threshold require human review.

[[curative]]
Curative::
An effect type for rules that fix existing issues in repositories. Curative rules modify files, create pull requests, or run commands. Contrast with <<preventive,Preventive>> and <<diagnostic,Diagnostic>>.

[[diagnostic]]
Diagnostic::
An effect type for rules that report issues without modifying the repository. Diagnostic rules produce reports, alerts, or metrics. Contrast with <<preventive,Preventive>> and <<curative,Curative>>.

[[distillation]]
Distillation::
The process of converting complex neural network patterns into simple, fast-acting symbolic rules. The core of the "dumb rules from smart learning" philosophy.

[[effect]]
Effect::
The category of action a rule performs. There are three effect types: <<preventive,Preventive>>, <<curative,Curative>>, and <<diagnostic,Diagnostic>>.

[[engine]]
Engine::
The Logtalk/SWI-Prolog component that executes rules and performs inference. The symbolic reasoning core of the platform.

[[forge]]
Forge::
A code hosting platform that provides Git repository hosting, issue tracking, CI/CD, and collaboration features. Examples: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Codeberg.

[[formal-verification]]
Formal Verification::
Mathematical proof that a rule satisfies certain properties, such as never decreasing repository health or not modifying existing files. Implemented using Liquid Haskell.

[[health-score]]
Health Score::
A numeric value (0-100) representing a repository's overall compliance with policies and best practices. Rules can improve, maintain, or (incorrectly) decrease this score.

[[hook]]
Hook::
A Git hook script installed in a repository that invokes cicd-hyper-a rules at specific points in the Git workflow (pre-commit, pre-push, post-receive).

[[inference]]
Inference::
The logical reasoning process by which the Logtalk engine derives conclusions from rules and facts. Enables complex policy evaluation.

[[learning]]
Learning::
The process by which cicd-hyper-a improves rules based on feedback from fix outcomes. Successful fixes increase confidence; failed fixes trigger rule refinement.

[[neurosymbolic]]
Neurosymbolic::
A hybrid approach combining neural networks (for pattern recognition and learning) with symbolic logic (for fast, deterministic rule execution). The foundational philosophy of cicd-hyper-a.

[[pattern]]
Pattern::
A regular expression or structured query used to match content in files, commits, or repository metadata.

[[preventive]]
Preventive::
An effect type for rules that block policy violations before they occur. Preventive rules reject commits, require approvals, or inject required files. Contrast with <<curative,Curative>> and <<diagnostic,Diagnostic>>.

[[property-based-testing]]
Property-Based Testing::
A testing methodology where tests specify properties that must hold for all inputs, rather than specific input-output pairs. Used to verify rule correctness. Implemented with QuickCheck.

[[provenance]]
Provenance::
The complete history and origin of a ruleset, including authorship, modifications, verifications, and signatures. Tracked in the <<audit-log,Audit Log>>.

[[registry]]
Registry::
The central repository of verified rulesets. Provides storage, versioning, search, and distribution of rulesets.

[[rule]]
Rule::
A declarative specification that matches a condition and performs an action. Rules are the fundamental unit of policy enforcement. See <<developer-guide.adoc#writing-rules,Writing Rules>>.

[[ruleset]]
Ruleset::
A named collection of related rules with shared metadata. Rulesets are versioned, signed, and distributed through the registry.

[[severity]]
Severity::
The importance level of an issue detected by a rule. Levels: Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info.

[[signature]]
Signature::
A cryptographic signature (GPG, SSH, or Sigstore) that authenticates the author of a ruleset and ensures integrity.

[[symbolic-reasoning]]
Symbolic Reasoning::
Logic-based reasoning using rules, facts, and inference. Provides deterministic, explainable decisions. Implemented in Logtalk/Prolog.

[[verification]]
Verification::
The process of proving that a ruleset satisfies required properties. Can be property-based testing or formal mathematical proof.

== Infrastructure Terms

[[arangodb]]
ArangoDB::
A multi-model database used for graph storage of repository relationships, rule dependencies, and organizational structure.

[[dragonfly]]
Dragonfly::
A Redis-compatible in-memory data store used for caching compiled rules. Provides sub-millisecond rule lookups.

[[helm]]
Helm::
A package manager for Kubernetes used to deploy cicd-hyper-a in production environments.

[[kubernetes]]
Kubernetes (K8s)::
A container orchestration platform used for production deployment of cicd-hyper-a services.

[[prometheus]]
Prometheus::
A metrics and monitoring system used to track cicd-hyper-a performance, throughput, and health.

[[radicle]]
Radicle::
A peer-to-peer code collaboration network used for decentralized ruleset distribution.

== Security Terms

[[branch-protection]]
Branch Protection::
A forge feature that restricts who can push to a branch and what conditions must be met (reviews, status checks). Often enforced by cicd-hyper-a rules.

[[code-review]]
Code Review::
The practice of having changes reviewed by another developer before merging. A common requirement in cicd-hyper-a security rules.

[[codeql]]
CodeQL::
A semantic code analysis engine used by GitHub for security scanning. cicd-hyper-a can configure and validate CodeQL workflows.

[[openssf-scorecard]]
OpenSSF Scorecard::
A tool that assesses open source project security practices. Many cicd-hyper-a rules align with Scorecard checks.

[[pinned-dependencies]]
Pinned Dependencies::
Dependencies locked to specific versions or commit hashes, rather than mutable tags. Prevents supply chain attacks.

[[secret-scanning]]
Secret Scanning::
Detection of accidentally committed credentials, API keys, or other sensitive data in code.

[[sha-pinning]]
SHA Pinning::
The practice of referencing GitHub Actions by commit SHA rather than version tag. Prevents tag mutation attacks.

SPDX::
Software Package Data Exchange, a standard for license identification. cicd-hyper-a rules enforce SPDX license headers.

[[supply-chain]]
Supply Chain (Security)::
The security of all components, dependencies, and processes involved in building and distributing software. cicd-hyper-a addresses supply chain security through dependency pinning and verification.
