== Overview

This roadmap outlines the development plan for Hypatia, the neurosymbolic CI/CD orchestrator for the Hyperpolymath gitbot fleet.

== v1.0 - Production Release (Current)

**Target:** 2026-02
**Status:** Active development (70-90% complete per components)

=== Core Components
* ✅ Haskell registry (template validation, type safety)
* ✅ Logtalk rules engine (logic programming, rule synthesis)
* ✅ Rust CLI (command execution, orchestration)
* ⚠️ ArangoDB deployment (needs production setup)

=== Features
* ✅ Template validation and scaffolding
* ✅ Rule-based package management
* ✅ Multi-language architecture
* ✅ Gitbot fleet integration hooks

=== Testing & Quality
* ✅ Unit tests
* ✅ Integration tests
* ✅ ClusterFuzzLite fuzzing
* ✅ Benchmarks
* ✅ Stress tests

=== Remaining for v1.0
* [ ] Add ROADMAP.adoc (this file)
* [ ] Production ArangoDB deployment
* [ ] V1 readiness validation rules (v1_readiness.lgt)
* [ ] Complete fleet orchestration
* [ ] Documentation and examples
