        # DETECTION GUIDE:
        # - Rust only: ['actions'] (CodeQL doesn't fully support Rust)
        # - OCaml only: ['actions'] (CodeQL doesn't support OCaml)
        # - JS/TS files in src/: ['actions', 'javascript-typescript']
        # - Python files in src/: ['actions', 'python']
        # - Go files: ['actions', 'go']
        #
        # 'actions' scans workflow files for security issues
