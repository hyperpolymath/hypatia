= Action Items — Requires Human Input

These items are blocked on credentials, external services, or decisions that
cannot be automated. Everything else is done and documented.

== Blocked on Credentials

[cols="1,3,1"]
|===
| Item | What to Do | Priority

| **GitHub PAT**
| Create a Personal Access Token with `repo` scope. Add as `VERISIMDB_PAT`
  secret to both `hypatia` and `verisimdb-data` repos on GitHub. This unblocks
  automated cross-repo dispatch (scan -> pattern -> recipe -> bot action).
  Without it, the pipeline works but dispatch requires manual
  `scripts/ingest-scan.sh` invocation.
| HIGH

| **Codeberg repos**
| Push-to-create is disabled on Codeberg. Either create the 10 monorepos via
  web UI or generate a fresh token with explicit `write:repository` scope.
  Repos: asdf-tool-plugins, asdf-augmenters, polystack, language-bridges,
  filesoup, nickel-augmentation, package-publishers, social-media-tools,
  ipv6-tools, games.
| LOW

| **Bitbucket repos**
| `bitfuckit repo create` has a confirmed bug (reports "done!" but repos
  not created). Either debug the tool, create repos via Bitbucket web UI,
  or use direct API calls. See `/var/mnt/eclipse/repos/bitfuckit/BITFUCKIT-BUG-REPORT.md`.

== Blocked on External Services

[cols="1,3,1"]
|===
| Item | What to Do | Priority

| **Deploy verisim-api**
| The VeriSimDB Rust API server needs deployment to enable native graph,
  vector, and temporal query modalities. Currently all VQL queries execute
  against flat files (FileExecutor). Build: `cd verisimdb && cargo build -p verisim-api`.
| MEDIUM

| **Deploy ArangoDB + Dragonfly**
| Transitional graph database for trust traversal, neural state, confidence
  history. Becomes optional once verisim-api is deployed with native stores.
| MEDIUM
|===

== Current State (for reference)

* **298 tests, 0 failures** (1 pre-existing timeout in pattern_analyzer_test)
* **22 fix recipes** covering PA001-PA005, PA010-PA013, PA015, PA017-PA018, PA020
* **Both ESN and RBF trained** (ESN: 2,538 points, RBF: 965 vectors/MSE=0.047)
* **223 VQL tests** (client, file_executor, query)
* **7 Zig FFI functions** fully implemented (no stubs)
* **Idris2 build system** operational (ipkg + pack.toml)
* **All pushed** to GitHub + GitLab

== What Can Be Done Without Human Input

These are the next engineering items (no credentials needed):

* More fix recipes for uncovered PA rules (PA006-PA009, PA014, PA016, PA019)
* Historical trend tracking across scan cycles
* SARIF output for IDE integration
* VQL federation executor (multi-store)
* Chapel NIFs for compute-heavy neural operations
* Idris2 database connectors for VeriSimDB (PostgreSQL, SQLite, ODBC)
